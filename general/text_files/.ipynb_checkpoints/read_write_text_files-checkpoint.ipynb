I read everything sent there, but if you ask me a question about using Python, it's likely that I won't have time to answer it, and will instead refer you to help (at) python.org, comp.lang.python or StackOverflow.

However, if you're American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian \"Guido\". I'm not too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people have. :-)\n",

      "Spelling: my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding. Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my first name, \"van\" is not capitalized: \"Guido van Rossum\". But when my last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for example: \"As usual, Van Rossum was right.\"\n",
